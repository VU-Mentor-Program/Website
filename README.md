# My React App

This is a React application created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). It serves as a starting point for building scalable and modern React-based web applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Yarn**: Install Yarn globally:
  ```bash
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/`. The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the app, run:
```bash
yarn build
```

The optimized build will be available in the `build/` directory.

### Running Tests

Run the tests with:
```bash
yarn test
```

You can use the interactive test runner to debug your tests.

### Cleaning the Project

To clean the project (remove `node_modules` and lock files), run:
```bash
yarn clean
```
